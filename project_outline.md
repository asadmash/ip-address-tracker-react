Step 1: Set Up Basic TypeScript Interfaces

    First, let's create your type definitions in the ip-data.types.ts file:
    Start with the main data interface that reflects the API response
    Add component prop interfaces
    Include any additional types you'll need

Step 2: Create Static Components

    Begin with implementing static UI components without worrying about functionality yet:

Header Component:

    Create the title and search form
    Style it according to the design with Tailwind
    Don't worry about form submission logic yet


InfoPanel and InfoItem Components:

    Build the white card with the four information sections
    Use hardcoded data for now
    Make sure to implement the dividers between sections


Map Component:

    Install react-leaflet: npm install react-leaflet leaflet @types/leaflet
    Create a basic map with a static marker
    Set initial coordinates to match your design



Step 3: Create the API Service

    Create the ip-geolocation.ts service:

    Implement the function to fetch IP data
    Handle error cases
    Return data according to your interface


Research free IP geolocation APIs:

    IPify is a good option (has a free tier)
    Create an account if needed to get an API key



Step 4: Connect Components with App State

    In App.tsx:

    Set up state for IP data, loading status, and errors
    Implement useEffect to fetch initial IP data
    Create a search handler function


    Pass state and handler functions as props to your components:

    Pass IP data to InfoPanel
    Pass coordinates to Map
    Pass search handler to Header



Step 5: Implement Interactivity

    Make the search form functional:

    Handle form submission in Header
    Validate input (check if valid IP or domain)
    Call the search handler from App


Connect InfoPanel to real data:

    Display loading state when fetching
    Show error message when API request fails
    Format and display the data properly


Make the Map update with new coordinates:

    Update marker position when new data comes in
    Add smooth transitions



Step 6: Responsive Design and Polish

    Ensure the layout works on mobile devices:

    Adjust InfoPanel layout for smaller screens
    Make sure the map is usable on mobile


Add finishing touches:

    Loading spinner or skeleton UI during API requests
    Error handling UI components
    Visual feedback when search is submitted
    Map marker styling
